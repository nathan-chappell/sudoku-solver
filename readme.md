Greetings!

This is a simple (read: not optimized) program to solve sudoku puzzles
written in python.  It was mostly just a small project for me to learn
a little bit about python before my exam next week...

Anyways, it is just about the most straightforward way to go about
doing a sudoku: brute force/ recursive descent/ backtracking...

Usage:
	Run the script, input the filename containing at the prompt

	If you don't input a filename, the default is 'puzzle'



There are example files to show what the puzzle should look like, just
note that while the double spaces/ double lines aren't mandatory,
different rows on different lines is mandatory.  Place a 0 where there
is no initial information.
